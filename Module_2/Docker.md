# Practice Quiz: Docker
**Total points:** 5
**Score:** 100%

## Question 1
You have created your first application and would like to test it before showing it to stakeholders. A colleague suggests using Docker to execute this task. What is Docker an example of? 

- An image
- A host machine
- A registry
- **A container technology**

*Some would consider Docker the most popular containerized technology to test new software on your machine.*

## Question 2
You have been talking to a colleague about how beneficial Docker has been to you for packaging and running applications in containers over the past several weeks. Your colleague has finally decided to install Docker on their local machine and reaches out to you for help with the installation process. Which method can your colleague execute to get Docker up and running on their machine? 

- **Installing Docker from the Docker website based on their operating system.**
- Executing the docker run hello-world command from the command line.
- Connecting to your machine and transferring Docker over to their local machine.
- Docker will automatically download to your colleagueâ€™s machine when they deploy their first application.

*Your colleague can install Docker, based on their operating system, from the Docker website.*

## Question 3
A colleague is discussing the combination of application code, data files, configuration, and libraries that are needed to run an application. What Docker term are they referring to? 

- A tag
- Layers
- An image
- **A container**

*An image contains all of the dependencies needed to run an application.*

## Question 4
A new programmer with your company has run into the issue of how to test multiple independent components together, which components must work properly in order for the application to run smoothly. What advice would you give the programmer to make their development process more efficient? 

- Use multiple registries to test the application.
- **Use multiple containers to test the different microservices of the application.**
- Reprogram the components so they are dependent on each other.
- Update the tags for each component to the same name.

*Using multiple containers to test the entirety of the application can be beneficial because the microservices are independent from one another.*

## Question 5
You share a new idea for an application with your team to get their feedback and any advice to make the application better. Some members of your team provide feedback on the build artifacts. Which of the following are examples of build artifacts? Select all that apply.

- **Libraries**
- **Documentation**
- **Scripts**
- Local machine

*Build artifacts are items created during the build process, including containers, documentation, libraries, and scripts.*

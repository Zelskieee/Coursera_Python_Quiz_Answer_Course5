## Question 1
Which types of tests are automated and run by a CI/CD pipeline? 

- **Unit, integration, and system.**
- Integration, delivery, and deployment.
- End-to-end, stress, and load.
- Jenkins, GitLab, and CircleCI.

*Unit, integration, and system are the types of tests commonly used to perform continuous testing in a CI/CD pipeline.*

## Question 2
Why is automated testing important? Select all that apply. 

- **It reduces the amount of manual work and the risk of human error.**
- It increases communication and collaboration. 
- It manages your source code repository and version histories.
- **It ensures that all of your code changes are tested early in the development process.**

*Automated testing ensures that all of your code changes are tested for errors or bugs, allowing you to create fixes as issues arise. It also reduces the risk of human error, especially when performing larger tests that would take time if conducted manually.*

## Question 3
Which actions typically trigger a CI/CD pipeline to start? Select all that apply.

- **A change in code.**
- A decrease in workflow efficiency.
- **A scheduled or user-initiated workflow.**
- **Another pipeline.**

*A change in code, a scheduled or user-initiated workflow, and another pipeline are all actions that could trigger a CI/CD pipeline to start.*

## Question 4
What are some advantages of implementing DevOps? 

- Continuous, iterative improvement of your applications.
- An automated software development lifecycle.
- Collaborative environments.
- **All of the above.**

*The advantages of implementing DevOps include an automated software development lifecycle, collaborative environments for the development and operations teams, and continuous, iterative improvements to your software or applications.*

## Question 5
Which of the following are benefits of using containers in your CI/CD pipeline? Select all that apply.

- **It allows you to deploy applications easily to multiple operating systems and hardware platforms.**
- It allows you to deploy multiple versions of an application at the same time without interfering with one another. 
- **It creates a more reliable way to work with applications at any stage in the pipeline process.**
- It allows you to continuously integrate code into your shared code repository.

*The benefits of using containers in your CI/CD pipeline include deploying applications easily to multiple operating systems and hardware platforms, deploying multiple versions of an application at the same time without interfering with one another, and creating a more reliable way to work with applications at any stage in the pipeline process.*

*The benefits of using containers in your CI/CD pipeline include deploying applications easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms, deploying multiple versions of an application at the same time without interfering with one another, and creating a more reliable way to work with applications at any stage in the pipeline process.*

**Total points:** 10
**Score:** 100%

## Question 1
When creating a template for a virtual machine (VM) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), what is the first step in the process?

- Increase CPU cores.
- Change the firewall settings.
- Create an instance template directly.
- **Shut down the VM instance.**

## Question 2
What is the primary purpose of the Google Cloud command-line interface (gcloud) in cloud computing?

- To develop mobile apps for Android and iOS.
- **To provide the primary CLI to Google Cloud Platform, to interact with VMs.**
- To analyze data and generate reports for business intelligence.
- To create web applications and databases.

## Question 3
What is the main purpose of the git clone command in relation to Git version control? 

- To start from scratch and build a new Git repository.
- **To transfer an established Git repository from an external location to one's own computer.**
- To create a fresh, empty Git repository locally.
- To obtain and incorporate updates into the local repository from a remote repository.

## Question 4
When creating an instance template in Google Cloud Platform, what is the purpose of setting the firewall to 'allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic'?

- To enable secure shell (SSH) access to the VM instances.
- To restrict all incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **To allow web traffic to and from the VM instances.**
- To configure the VM instances for database access.

## Question 5
What is the primary purpose of the gcloud command in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ecosystem? 

- To order physical hardware for on-premises data centers.
- To create and maintain virtual private networks (VPNs) for secure data transfer.
- To manage GCP resources, configure settings, and deploy applications.
- **To interact with Google Cloud Storage for data warehousing.**

## Question 6
What is the significance of configuring the firewall to 'allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic' in the 'vm1-template'?

- To enable remote desktop connections to the VM instances.
- To set up a VPN connection for the VM instances.
- **To ensure all VM instances created with this template can handle web traffic securely.**
- To configure email services on the VM instances.

## Question 7
What is the purpose of cloning the hello_cloud.py file to the /usr/local/bin/ location during the setup of this lab?

- To store the VM image.
- To enable auto-scaling.
- **To run the script on boot.**
- To create a template.

## Question 8
how would you typically apply updates or changes to an existing VM instance template (like 'vm1-template')?

- By updating the template, which automatically updates all associated VM instances.
- By using a specific GCP command to push updates to the template and its instances.
- **By deleting the existing template and creating a new one with the required updates.**
- By manually updating each VM instance created from the template.

## Question 9
What is the purpose of creating an image named "vm-image" based on the "vm1" disk in the provided instructions?

- **To create a template for creating new VM instances with similar configurations as vm1.**
- To clone the entire VM instance vm1.
- To create a backup of the VM instance vm1.
- To resize the disk of the VM instance vm1.

## Question 10
You have successfully created new VM instances using the "vm1-template" template as described in the instructions. Now, you want to view the list of these VM instances. How can you accomplish this?

- Run the command "gcloud instances list vm1-template" from the local terminal.
- Use the "gcloud list instances" command from the local terminal.
- Execute the "gcloud compute instances view" command from your local computer.
- **Access the Compute Engine > VM instance page in the GCP Console.**
